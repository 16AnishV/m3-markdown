# Exercise-3

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.


## Open

The open command can be used to open a file using Terminal. For example: 

```open filename.r```

 - If you put a space between multiple files, you can open more than one at a time: ```open file1.r file2.r file3.r file4.html file5.txt```
 - You can use the "open -a" command to open a file in a specified application (if perhaps you wish to open it in something other than the default application). For example:
```open -a XCode filename.r``` OR ```open -a Sublime Text filename.r```
